# File Transfer Overview

There are a variety of methods available to move files into and out of
the Science Portal. This page provides a short summary of the options,
with links to further resources that are available.

-   upload individual files (Notebook): Small files can be easily
    uploaded within a Notebook session using the upload icon. A tutorial
    is available [here](science-containers/general/Notebook/transfer_file/)
-   upload/download files or directories using the [web browser
    interface](https://www.canfar.net/storage/arc/list/home) for the
    storage associated with the Science Portal. A tutorial is available
    [here](science-containers/general/General_tools/Using_webstorage/).
-   upload/download files or directories from the command line using the
    VOS Tools software. See a basic tutorial
    [here](science-containers/general/General_tools/Using_vostools/).
-   mount the file system to your local computer using sshfs. See a
    basic tutorial [here](https://www.opencadc.org/science-containers/general/General_tools/Using_sshfs/).
-   command line interaction to upload/download files through a direct
    url. See a brief description [here](science-containers/general/TipsTricks/Direct_url/).
